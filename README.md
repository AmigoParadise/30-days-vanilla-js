# 30 Days of Vanilla JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day coding journey! This repository is dedicated to building 30 different web projects using pure Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) to strengthen my foundational programming skills.

## 🧠 Learning Methodology & Attribution

I believe in transparency and continuous learning. For this challenge:
* **AI as a Mentor:** I am using **Gemini AI** as my virtual instructor to guide the project architecture and logic.
* **Code-Along Process:** I do not simply copy and paste. I **manually retype every line of code** generated to build muscle memory, understand syntax patterns, and internalize the program flow.
* **Goal:** My primary objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge (from *The Odin Project*) and practical application.
